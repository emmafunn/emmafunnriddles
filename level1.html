<p>Welcome to <strong>Level 1</strong> of EmmaFunnRiddles!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I'm going to go over what this adventure will be like for you.</p>
<p>Every answer you find will be a word or phrase attainable through information given from the page you are on.</p>
<p>When you find the answer, replace what comes before .html with that answer. Don't include capital letters or spaces.</p>
<p>So, for example, this page reads "...level1.html". If you find out that the answer to this level is "fun", replace "level1" with the word "fun".</p>
<p>However, the answer to this level is not fun. Good luck!<p>
<p> If you really, really need help you can type in "hints" before .html</p>
